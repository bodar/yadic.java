yadic.java
==========

Yet Another Dependency Injection Container (Java version)

A _super small_ and _lightening fast_ *dependency injection* container for Java written in Java.

*Yadic (.Net) is still on [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/yadic/)*

Yadic is now available for [Ruby](http://github.com/benbc/yadic.rb)

*Yadic* is a container with attitude and aligns itself with the following tenets;

  * lightweight (only 12KB)
  * lightening fast (1 million resolves in 0.28s)
  * simple (only 2 main functions)
  * configuration in code (not in XML)
  * one lifetime choice (the lifetime of the container)
  * good code design (built in decorator pattern)
  * open (can chain _any_ vendor container)
